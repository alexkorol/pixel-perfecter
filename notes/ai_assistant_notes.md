# AI Assistant Notes: Pixel Art Reconstruction Progress (2025-06-11)

## What Worked in the Latest Pipeline

- **Edge-projection peak analysis** was used to empirically detect the grid size and offset for each input image.
- For each detected grid cell, the modal color was assigned to a single output pixel, producing a true pixel art image at the empirically determined grid resolution.
- The output images were upscaled for validation overlays, with differences highlighted in red.
- This method produced good results for the 'star' and 'pollen' images, which previously failed or were not reconstructed correctly.

## What Did Not Work

- For the 'smiley' and 'red triangle' images, the detected grid was too large, resulting in outputs with loose, distorted, or noisy sub-pixels.
- The grid guess was off for these images, leading to a loss of pixel structure and the appearance of artifacts.
- The method is sensitive to grid detection errors, which can cause the output to be either too coarse or to contain misplaced pixels.

## Next Steps

- Continue iterating on the grid detection logic to improve robustness, especially for images where the grid is not as visually obvious.
- Explore additional validation metrics to programmatically detect when the output is noisy or the grid guess is off (e.g., by analyzing the difference overlay or the distribution of output pixel colors).
- Document all changes and empirical findings in this file to ensure reproducibility and knowledge retention.
