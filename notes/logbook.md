# Dev Log: pixel-perfecter v2

## 2025-06-11

**Rebooted project.** Old code moved to `legacy_attempt/`.

- Refocused effort on clean grid alignment from modal block sizes
- First good result with red triangle (32Ã—32 grid, confirmed manually)
- Starting new scripts from scratch in `src/`

Next:
- Port clean block-snapper code into `src/`
- Test blue heart sprite with proper modal detection
